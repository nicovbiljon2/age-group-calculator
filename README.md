# age-group-calculator

My first JavaScript project!

A simple JavaScript project that calculates a user's age group based on their input.

Features:

- Takes user input for age
- Calculates the age group:
  - Child (0–12)
  - Teenager (13–17)
  - Adult (18–64)
  - Senior (65+)
- Simple, clean interface
- Built with HTML, and JavaScript

Technologies Used:

- HTML
- JavaScript

How it works:

1. User gets prompted to enter their age using `prompt()`.
2. The app checks the age using simple `if-else` conditions.
3. It shows the corresponding age group:
   - Child (0–12)
   - Teenager (13–17)
   - Adult (18–64)
   - Senior (65+)
